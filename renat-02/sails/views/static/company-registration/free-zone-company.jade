            b Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA)
            |  - In order to promote international trade and investment, in 1985 the first free economic zone in the UAE for the registration of companies was established in the Emirate of Dubai. By itself, this is a free economic zone - limited area in regions with a special legal status in relation to the rest of the territory and favorable economic conditions for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs.
            | Creation of the first free economic zone has been so successful from an economic point of view, that this project model has been widely copied after Dubai to other emirates.
            p To date, only one Dubai has more than 20 free trade zones, each of which focused on the incorporation of companies of a certain type of activity. Total number of FEZ in the UAE is 30.

          ul.marked-list
            li
              b Foreign Branch
              |  - a branch of a foreign company;
            li

              b Free Zone Company (FZCO)
              |  - from 2 to 5 founders.
          p 
            | In contrast to a branch of a foreign company FZE and FZCO companies are separate legal entities. They represent a kind of a limited liability company.
            | The founders of such companies can be both physical and legal persons of any residence except Israel. The minimum   | authorized capital is dependent on the type of activity (type of license), as well as the form of the company and may vary from 50,000 dirhams (such as in the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC)) to 1 000 000 dirhams (such as Jebel Ali Free Zone ( JAFZA)). In some cases, the number of FEZ in the authorized capital of UAE is small or has the ability to delay its introduction.
          p 
            | All of the above forms of companies are entitled to the registration of three-year residence visa for investors, the company's employees and their families.

            li.b Professional;
            li.b Industrial.
          p
            | Kindly note that the license of a free economic zone in the United Arab Emirates gives the right to conduct operations only within the free economic zone and on the international market.
