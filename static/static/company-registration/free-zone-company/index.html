By itself, this is a free economic zone - limited area in regions with a special legal status in relation to the rest of the territory and favorable economic conditions for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs.
Creation of the first free economic zone has been so successful from an economic point of view, that this project model has been widely copied after Dubai to other emirates.<p>To date, only one Dubai has more than 20 free trade zones, each of which focused on the incorporation of companies of a certain type of activity. Total number of FEZ in the UAE is 30.</p></p></dd><dt class="h3 text-medium">Benefits of registering a company in the free economic zones of the UAE</dt><dd class="text-light"> <ul class="marked-list"><li>100% Repatriation of revenue and the lack of income tax;</li><li>100% ownership of the company;</li><li>100% absence of import and export duties;</li><li>Resident visa and residence permit for the founders and staff of the company;</li><li>The full, right to use banking services and other financial services (credit cards, checkbooks, interest-free cash withdrawal from current accounts, etc.).</li><li>The absence of taxation of profits, a zero withholding tax income rate in the UAE and as a result 100% repatriation of proceeds received from the source in the territory of the Emirates are characteristics of free economic zones, applicable for the whole territory of the United Arab Emirates.</li></ul><p>Possibility of registering a company in the free economic zone has allowed foreign investors to obtain an independent 100% sole ownership and control of the company.
